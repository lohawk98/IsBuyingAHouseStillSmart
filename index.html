   <h1>Why buying a house is not as great as it used to be.</h1>
   
   <p>Buying a home is known as part of the American Dream. Having a white picket fence,
   a backyard to play with the kids and pets, along with a gargage.</p>
   
   <p>Buying a house was also finacially smart too, as it was known
   to cement your place in the middle class. Housing prices when up and down, 
   but in the long run, housing was always a safe and smart investment.</p>
